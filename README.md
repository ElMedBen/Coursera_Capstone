A hypothetic investor wants to analyze the current market situation of food shops and coffee shops in the city of Casablanca. The reason why his choice isn’t clear, is because the city is known as the economic capitol of Morocco. It’s a melting pot of multiple types of activities and is described by a rich diversity in termed of nationalities and their respective ethnicities (some kind of alpha version of New York). Because of this diverse characteristic, food venues are also diverse and are strictly not limited to one type. They span from Famous Fast-Food brands, to dinners and small food shops.

For the restaurant category, each can be available with a specific type of cuisine (Italian, French, Spanish…), which also make things more complicated. As for coffees, even if their type of diversity isn’t an issue, the decision on opening a coffee shop or a restaurant is also a relevant problem for the investor. Another big issue is related to the location of these venues. Where in the city should he make his project happen? This location problem is an important one since it could impact directly the success of venue. Our hypothetic investor has money but doesn’t have the time neither the necessary tools to analyze the data and to make the right decision. For this reason, it was proposed to extract data from the Foursquare’s API. These contains information about the geographical location, the type of venue, their names and their related likes. Within our current work, our main objective knowing the problem, is to make recommendation based on the Foursquare’s API about these tree aspects:

*Location analysis
*Analysis of the trending category of venue (fast-food, restaurant, cafe…)
*Analysis of the type of cuisine if restaurants are chosen (French, spinach, Japanese…)

These different aspects can be studied based on the “likes” that are provided by the API. An analysis will be conducted to evaluate the overall usability of this data to optimize the decision on these issues.
